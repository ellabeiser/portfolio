## Work Experience

**Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting**, Remote, June 2025-May 2025

_Editorial Intern_  
At the Pulitzer Center I worked primarily with the publishing team, copy editing for AP style and clarity. I interviewed Pulitzer Center grantees in English and Spanish about their reporting process and spent time designing social media posts and videos to promote the content. I trained two days a week with the data and research team where I learned basic open source research techniques and honed my data wrangling, visualization and mapmaking skills.

**The Bates Student** | Bates College | September 2023-June 2025
_Editor in Chief_   

At _The Student_, I managed a 21-person staff. In the absence of a faculty advisor or a journalism program at our college, I made final editorial decisions and designed and led consistent training programs for incoming writers. On average, I edited and coached approximately 50 stories per month. During my junior year, I revived our print publication, which had lapsed during the pandemic, and trained staff in Adobe InDesign and Photoshop. Over my four years at the paper, I also published 38 articles of my own.

During my senior year at the paper, the SPLC published revised guidelines on "take-down" requests due to increased risks to international students. In response I reached out to other student newspapers and organized weekly meetings to discuss changes and challenges we were facing.
